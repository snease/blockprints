# ExecPlans
When writing complex features or significant refactors, use an ExecPlan (as described in docs/plans.md) from design to implementation.
# Requirements (docs/prd.md)
When writing requirements iterate with the prompter frequently. Propose edits section-by-section and prefer an iterative approach to writing them. Show proposed edits as diffs. Use the write_requirements skill for proposing and applying edits.
